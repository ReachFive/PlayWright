Pre-requisite: settings -> Project: PlayWright -> Python interpreter -> add the Package pytest-xdist

GitHub URL: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist

To send tests to multiple CPUs, use the -n (or --numprocesses) option:

pytest -n auto

This can lead to considerable speed ups, especially if your test suite takes a noticeable amount of time.

With -n auto, pytest-xdist will use as many processes as your computer has physical CPU cores.

Pass a number, e.g. -n 8, to specify the number of processes explicitly.
